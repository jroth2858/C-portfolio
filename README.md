This course is broken into 24 sections each with a specific focus. Each folder in the `challenges` directory contains my own implementation of the instructor-prescribed "challenges" for each of the course sections. 

Challenges can be run and compiled with `Make` via `make -s section <X>` where `<x>` is the section number. Each sub challenge will be run in that sections directory. Note that the option `-s` is provided to silently run `make` and provides a cleaner output.
